seq192(1) -- live MIDI sequencer
=============================

## SYNOPSIS

`seq192` [OPTION...]

## DESCRIPTION

seq192 is a MIDI sequencer for live situations that is meant to be controlled with OSC messages and sync with other applications using jack transport.

## OPTIONS

* `-h, --help`:
    Show available options

* `-f, --file` <file>:
    Load midi file on startup

* `-c, --config` <file>:
    Load config file on startup

* `-p, --osc-port` <port>:
    OSC input port (udp port number or unix socket path)

* `-j, --jack-transport`:
    Sync to jack transport

* `-n, --no-gui`:
    Enable headless mode

* `-v, --version`:
    Show version and exit

## USER INTERFACE

Seq192 allows writing and playing MIDI sequences and organizing them in screensets.

**Main window**

The main window consist in a toolbar and a sequence grid.

* The **toolbar** contains the following controls

    *Panic button*: disable all sequences<br/>
    *Stop button*: stop transport<br/>
    *Play button*: start or restart transport<br/>
    *Bpm entry*: set beats per minute<br/>
    *Screenset name entry*: set name of current screenset<br/>
    *Screenset number entry*: select current screenset<br/>

* The **sequence grid** is empty by default. Right-clicking in the grid allows creating a new sequence or editing an existing one. Sequences can be rearranged in the grid by dragging them. Left-clicking on a sequence toggles its playing state. Middle-clicking on a sequence opens its edit window. Shift+click defines the sequence as the synchronization reference for queued sequences. Ctrl+click toggles the sequence's queued state. The keyboard's arrow keys can be used to navigate accross sequences.

**Edit window**

The edit window consist in a menu, a toolbar, a pianoroll and an event editor.

* The **toolbar** contains the following controls

    *Sequence name entry*: set name of sequence<br/>
    *Sequence length entries*: set number of beats per measure, beat unit and number of measures in sequence<br/>
    *Snap button*: toggle grid snapping. Holding `alt` allows disabling snapping temporarily<br/>
    *Snap dropdown*: set snapping grid size<br/>
    *Note dropdown*: set note size  <br/>
    *Output dropdown*: set sequence's MIDI port and channel<br/>

* The **pianoroll** responds to the following interactions

    *Left click (piano area)*: send note to sequence's output<br/>
    *Left click*: select note(s)<br/>
    *Left click drag*: create a lasso selection or move selection<br/>
    *Middle click (or ctrl + left click) drag*: change note(s) duration<br/>
    *Right click + left click*: draw new notes<br/>

* The **event editor** allows editing the velocity of notes and adding MIDI events like pitch wheel and control changes to the sequences The button on the left allows selecting which event should be shown on the timeline. The timeline works like in the piano roll, except events dont have a length. The bottom part is for editing the events' values: handles can be dragged individually, or one can draw a line with a drag-and-drop motion to create a linear automation. Scrolling with the mousewheel on the event editor increments the values of all selected events.

**Important note**

Each window has its own undo/redo history:

    - main window: screnset name and sequences (position and content)
    - edit window: MIDI events, sequence name, number of measures and time signature


## JACK TRANSPORT

When `--jack-transport` is set, seq192 will

    - follow start / stop commands from other clients
    - send start / stop commands to other clients
    - use the transport master's bpm
    - set its position to 0 whenever the transport stops or restarts
    - **not** attempt to reposition within sequences


## CONFIGURATION FILE

The configration file is located in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/seq192/config.json` (`~/.config/seq192/config.json` by default), but can be loaded from any location using `--config`. It allows customizing the following aspects of seq192:

    - MIDI bus names
    - MIDI channel names per bus
    - Sequence colors as css color strings (per bus or per channel )
    - Note names in the piano roll (per bus or per channel)
    - Control names in the event dropdown (per bus or per channel )

**Example**

<pre>
{
    "buses": {
        "0": {
            "name": "Sampler",
            "channels": {
                "0": {
                    "name": "Drums",
                    "color": "orange",
                    "notes": {
                        "64": "Kick",
                        "65": "Snare",
                        "66": "Hihat"
                    },
                    "controls": {
                        "1": "Custom cc name ",
                        "2": "Etc"
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "1": {
            "name": "Bass synth",
            "channels":{
                "0": {"name": "Trap bass"},
                "1": {"name": "Wobble"}
